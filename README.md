A JavaScript Tool to scrap Leetcode Questions PowerFul, Grabber. Create Readme.md and other fun stuffs


## 🐱‍🏍 Building Leetcode Web Crawler | Powerful for Building Readme.MD 🙌 | Web Worker API | NodeJs

My first Yt-video is on making a Leetcode Crawler using NodeJs fun project. The idea came to my mind while preparing for Coding Interviews. I think this is so much helpful to **store problem statements + I/O in a single folder.**🐱‍🏍



Because I found it's a boring repeating job, from Now it's not. I also studied Web Workers from Mozilla Tuts. 

Really helped a lot for understanding partitioning you bunch of works through web workers to web content to run scripts in background threads. 🐱‍🏍❤



Inspiration from **Rachit Jain sir's CodeforcesContestBot**. Since I started practicing and building foundations more strong on Coding Interview Problems for me and like my others - "Hope This Video & Bot is helpful :-)"
